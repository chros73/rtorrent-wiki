============================

 * the [User Guide](https://github.com/rakshasa/rtorrent/wiki/User-Guide) explains how to use the ‘curses’ UI, and what the displayed information actually means.
 * the [Configuration Guide](https://github.com/rakshasa/rtorrent/wiki/Config-Guide) helps you to adapt rTorrent to serve your needs.
 * the [Scripting Guide](https://github.com/rakshasa/rtorrent/wiki/Scripting-Guide) allows ‘power users’ to extend rTorrent's configuration with more complex logic, and control it remotely via XMLRPC.
