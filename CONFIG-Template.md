# rTorrent Configuration Template

This page contains a modern rTorrent configuration that provides a good starting point.
Its expressed purpose is to replace that years-old rotting piece of garbage that people still use to create their first configuration. Friends don't let friends use that!

It uses `0.9.x` syntax, so be sure to run snippets you add through
the migration script. Be considerate in what you add, this is supposed
to help new users to jump-start their installation, so keep things
out that are not applicable to a wide range of people. Place advanced
use-cases in the appropriate sections of the wiki like the
[Configuration Guide](https://github.com/rakshasa/rtorrent/wiki/Config-Guide).

```ini
# A minimal rTorrent configuration that provides the basic features
# you want to have in addition to the built-in defaults.

# BIG TODO
