# rTorrent Configuration Template

This page contains a modern rTorrent configuration that provides a good starting point.
Its expressed purpose is to replace that years-old rotting piece of garbage that people still use to create their first configuration. Friends don't let friends use that.

```ini
# A minimal rTorrent configuration that provides the basic features
# you want to have in addition to the built-in defaults.

# BIG TODO


### END of rtorrent.rc ###
