# Things TO-DO in This Wiki

This is just a list of explicit items or links to work on. Pretty much everything else is a TODO too, including command references and configuration how-tos.

## Assemble tid-bits out there

 * Command lists, brackets etc.: https://github.com/rakshasa/rtorrent/issues/384#issuecomment-193987276
 * DHT Bootstrap: https://github.com/rakshasa/rtorrent/issues/158
 * XMLRPC - setting prios: https://github.com/rakshasa/rtorrent/issues/361
 * Auto-translated from Russian (original [here](https://habrahabr.ru/post/238413/)), but looks quite comprehensive: [We deal with rtorrent seriously](http://developers-club.com/posts/238413/)
